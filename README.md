**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

Now days there are many accedient happening now days for that we need to do something so our team had decided to make an app which will fetch the nearest hospital around you and give you the phone number of that hospital and other details of it . If there are like extream condition it will open an dial pad in your phone of the nearest hospital which will help in emergency situation or in pandamic once.  


**WHY reLIVE:**

2. Availabe 24*7

3. Saving life of patients.

4. Make a call to hospial with one touch(Real-Time Communication).

We also faced problems in the storing in the database.
